## Indian Camp

Ernest Hemingway



Hemingway is a economical writer 用词简练、惜墨如金

$\Uparrow$  telegraphic style



Iceberg Theory / principle

Writers should hide the most of info to make the novel seemingly simple

Seemingly / Deceptively simple



> At the lake shore there was another rowboat drawn up. The two Indians stood waiting.  --P1



<!--唐突：another,。但实际上是接上文的-->

<!--Nick 是贯穿整个短篇小说集的主人公-->

<!--craftsmanship 精工细作-->



**stood is a simple word, but hemingway use it effectively**

* suggest the situation is urgent
  * they must had been waiting for a long time
  * even standing up took time





> P2

"Stern of the boat" 与 "shove it off"反复重复

Some patterns are repeated. 这与H少说话的风格不符

是为了反托出他们的沉默

* 没有说话的必要

  

> P3
>
> The Boat started off in the dark

全段"Dark" 和 "Mist"反复重复

Q: why H st

最后一句，一艘(带乔治叔叔的)很快另一艘更快强调了情况紧急？



> where are we going dad
>
> over to the indian camp, there is an Indian lady very sick
>
> oh

H是描写对话的高手

描写了Nick打破沉默，非常写实

"where are we going dad"具有哲学意义

内容深刻？？



> Across the bay they found th other boat beached

"In the dark": 

"cigar": Uncle G 抽雪茄，暗示有钱，后文中印第安人只能抽pipe





> They walked up

"dew"暗示已经过了午夜了

> > Then they went into the woods and followed a trail that led to a logging road that ran back into the hills. 

从句套从句

到亮的地方就灭灯笼，说明此处很穷



> They came  around

> > a dog cam out barking

说明他们此前没来过？



> Inside on the wooden 

"Inside" 将文章分开
