Some formulation from the story

1. life can be violent, although we often associate death with violence

   1. the baby is born unnaturally
   2. more and more lives came to 
   3. violence $\Longrightarrow$ caesarean

2. life can be bloody, although we often connect blood with death



$\Longrightarrow$ life and death can be very closed to each others

在小说中生死靠的很近

death can be easy while life can be diffcult



He killed himeself so that his baby could be born



Such a baby can't not be naturally born but can only be  brought to this world by force

## The Story of an Hour

heart trouble 和 heart disease在此篇小说中不能互换、                                   

设定Richards的身份：he is well-informed

Time and Truth are 2 souls of news

took the time 慢悠悠

先慢悠悠地确认再马不停蹄地去



椅子并不舒服，说明她进房间之后就停止伤心了，因为悲伤的人无法感觉椅子是否舒适

甚至可以看到树梢在抖动



She saw what she wanted to see

并且只看到树梢说明非常写实



our eyes and nose and ears are picky 选择性看树梢，选择性闻雨后清新，选择性听叫卖声和音乐

### Q

1. she was imagining herself of sth 她把自己想想成某种动物
2. heart trouble 和 heart disease 有什么区别
