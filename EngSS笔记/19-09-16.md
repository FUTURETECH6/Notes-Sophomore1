这个看你哦，做笔记肯定是好的，因为考试可能考到他讲的内容；但是因为非常无聊所以做笔记挺艰难的[捂脸]

他上课的文意、句意理解可以记一记，考判断题；重难点句子、表达可以记一记，考翻译题

#### Poetry

How ancestors entertain other?

* only on their physical bodies
  * easiest
* mouth mainly
  * speaking
  * singing
  * no oral language
    * meanlingless sound $\Longrightarrow$ original language
* hands, legs, move their bodies

That's why the poetry is the first one

<u>Poetry is just the speech(oraly deliveredl, not written)</u>



#### Drama

##### Why drama earlier then novels

* Drama is very close to poetry???
  * d is 
    * the earliest lines in D were all in verse(诗句)
    * D = speech(P) + action
  * D evolves from P



#### Novel

from D to N: ~~evolution~~ revolution

P & D are predecessors
